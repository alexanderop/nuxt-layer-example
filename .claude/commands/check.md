# Check project health

Run comprehensive checks on the project:

1. Run `pnpm build` to check for build errors
2. Run `npx eslint .` to check for linting issues
3. Report any errors found
4. Suggest fixes if issues are discovered

This command helps ensure the project is in a good state before committing changes.
