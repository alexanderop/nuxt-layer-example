## How to use:

3. This file will be loaded alongside the main CLAUDE.md

## Example content:

```markdown
# My Local Development Notes

## Personal Preferences
- I prefer to use the --open flag when running pnpm dev
- My local dev server should run on port 3001 (use: pnpm dev --port 3001)

## Machine-Specific Paths
- My design files are in ~/Documents/Projects/nuxt-app-designs/

## Private Notes
- Testing credentials stored in 1Password vault "Dev Credentials"
- Staging server: https://staging.example.com

## My Common Tasks
- When I say "deploy", I mean run the build and preview it locally first
- When working on forms, always add proper validation and accessibility
